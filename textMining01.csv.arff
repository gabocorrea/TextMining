'\nProvides a framework for viewers, which are model-based\ncontent adapters for SWT widgets.\n<h2>\nPackage Specification</h2>\nA viewer is a model-based adapter on an SWT widget.&nbsp; Each viewer has\nfour parts:\n<blockquote>\n<li>\nan <b>input</b> - the object that serves as the viewer\'s model</li>\n\n<li>\na <b>widget</b> - the SWT control through which the viewer\'s model is displayed</li>\n\n<li>\na <b>content provider</b> - mediates between the model and viewer</li>\n\n<li>\na <b>label provider</b> - maps model objects to displayable labels containing\ntext and/or an image</li>\n</blockquote>\nThis package contains the viewer framework. The viewer framework is an\nindependent JFace module. Using it requires a knowledge of SWT, but does\nnot require familiarity with any of the other JFace modules. The framework\nconsists of abstract base classes for viewers (<tt>Viewer</tt>, <tt>StructuredViewer</tt>,\n<tt>AbstractTreeViewer</tt>) together with concrete viewer classes (<tt>ListViewer</tt>,\n<tt>TreeViewer</tt>,\n<tt>TableViewer</tt>,\n<tt>TableTreeViewer</tt>, <tt>CheckboxTreeViewer</tt>,\nand <tt>CheckboxTableViewer</tt>),\nand various lesser support classes. The concrete structured viewer classes\nare ready-to-use and have built-in support for drag-and-drop, filtering\n(<tt>IViewerFilter</tt> and <tt>ViewerFilter</tt>), and sorting (<tt>IViewerSorter</tt>\nand <tt>ViewerSorter</tt>); these classes may also be subclassed further\nif required.\n<p>In general terms, creating a viewer involves the following steps:\n<ul>\n<li>\ninstantiating a viewer on some pre-existing SWT widget,</li>\n\n<li>\nsetting the viewer\'s content provider (an object implementing <tt>IContentProvider</tt>),</li>\n\n<li>\nsetting the viewer\'s label provider (an object implementing\n<tt>ILabelProvider</tt>),</li>\n\n<li>\nand, finally, setting the viewer\'s input.</li>\n</ul>\nOnce a viewer\'s input is set, the viewer becomes active.

'\n\n\nProvides reference-object classes, which support a limited degree of\ninteraction with the garbage collector.  A program may use a reference object\nto maintain a reference to some other object in such a way that the latter\nobject may still be reclaimed by the collector.  A program may also arrange to\nbe notified some time after the collector has determined that the reachability\nof a given object has changed.\n\n\n<h2>Package Specification</h2>\n\nA <em>reference object</em> encapsulates a reference to some other object so\nthat the reference itself may be examined and manipulated like any other\nobject.  Three types of reference objects are provided, each weaker than the\nlast: <em>soft</em>, <em>weak</em>, and <em>phantom</em>.  Each type\ncorresponds to a different level of reachability, as defined below.  Soft\nreferences are for implementing memory-sensitive caches, weak references are\nfor implementing canonicalizing mappings that do not prevent their keys (or\nvalues) from being reclaimed, and phantom references are for scheduling\npre-mortem cleanup actions in a more flexible way than is possible with the\nJava finalization mechanism.\n\n<p> Each reference-object type is implemented by a subclass of the abstract\nbase <code>{@link java.lang.ref.Reference}</code> class.  An instance of one of\nthese subclasses encapsulates a single reference to a particular object, called\nthe <em>referent</em>.  Every reference object provides methods for getting and\nclearing the reference.  Aside from the clearing operation reference objects\nare otherwise immutable, so no <code>set</code> operation is provided.  A\nprogram may further subclass these subclasses, adding whatever fields and\nmethods are required for its purposes, or it may use these subclasses without\nchange.\n\n\n<h3>Notification</h3>\n\nA program may request to be notified of changes in an object\'s reachability by\n<em>registering</em> an appropriate reference object with a <em>reference\nqueue</em> at the time the reference object is created.  Some time after the\ngarbage collector determines that the reachability of the referent has changed\nto the value corresponding to the type of the reference, it will add the\nreference to the associated queue.  At this point, the reference is considered\nto be <em>enqueued</em>.  The program may remove references from a queue either\nby polling or by blocking until a reference becomes available.  Reference\nqueues are implemented by the <code>{@link java.lang.ref.ReferenceQueue}</code>\nclass.\n\n<p> The relationship between a registered reference object and its queue is\none-sided.  That is, a queue does not keep track of the references that are\nregistered with it.  If a registered reference becomes unreachable itself, then\nit will never be enqueued.  It is the responsibility of the program using\nreference objects to ensure that the objects remain reachable for as long as\nthe program is interested in their referents.\n\n<p> While some programs will choose to dedicate a thread to removing reference\nobjects from one or more queues and processing them, this is by no means\nnecessary.  A tactic that often works well is to examine a reference queue in\nthe course of performing some other fairly-frequent action.  For example, a\nhashtable that uses weak references to implement weak keys could poll its\nreference queue each time the table is accessed.  This is how the <code>{@link\njava.util.WeakHashMap}</code> class works.  Because the <code>{@link\njava.lang.ref.ReferenceQueue#poll ReferenceQueue.poll}</code> method simply\nchecks an internal data structure, this check will add little overhead to the\nhashtable access methods.\n\n\n<h3>Automatically-cleared references</h3>\n\nSoft and weak references are automatically cleared by the collector before\nbeing added to the queues with which they are registered, if any.  Therefore\nsoft and weak references need not be registered with a queue in order to be\nuseful, while phantom references do.  An object that is reachable via phantom\nreferences will remain so until all such references are cleared or themselves\nbecome unreachable.\n\n\n<a name=\"reachability\"></a>\n<h3>Reachability</h3>\n\nGoing from strongest to weakest, the different levels of reachability reflect\nthe life cycle of an object.  They are operationally defined as follows:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li> An object is <em>strongly reachable</em> if it can be reached by some\nthread without traversing any reference objects.  A newly-created object is\nstrongly reachable by the thread that created it.\n\n<li> An object is <em>softly reachable</em> if it is not strongly reachable but\ncan be reached by traversing a soft reference.\n\n<li> An object is <em>weakly reachable</em> if it is neither strongly nor\nsoftly reachable but can be reached by traversing a weak reference.  When the\nweak references to a weakly-reachable object are cleared, the object becomes\neligible for finalization.\n\n<li> An object is <em>phantom reachable</em> if it is neither strongly, softly,\nnor weakly reachable, it has been finalized, and some phantom reference refers\nto it.\n\n<li> Finally, an object is <em>unreachable</em>, and therefore eligible for\nreclamation, when it is not reachable in any of the above ways.\n\n</ul>\n\n\n@version  1.11, 04/02/10\n@author\t  Mark Reinhold\n@since\t  1.2\n\n<!--\n<h2>Related Documentation</h2>\n\nFor overviews, tutorials, examples, guides, and tool documentation, please see:\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"\">##### REFER TO NON-SPEC DOCUMENTATION HERE #####</a>\n</ul>\n-->\n',directive

The details as to how the load is initiated, is implementation\ndependent.\n\n<h3>Command-Line Interface</h3>\n\n<P> \nOn implementations with a command-line interface, an agent is started by\nadding this option to the command-line:\n<blockquote>\n<code><b>-javaagent:</b></code><i>jarpath[</i><code><b>=</b></code><i>options]</i>\n</blockquote>\n<i>jarpath</i> is the path to the agent JAR file.\n<i>options</i> is the agent options.\nThis switch may be used multiple times on the same command-line, \nthus creating multiple agents.\nMore than one agent may use the same <i>jarpath</i>.\nAn agent JAR file must conform to the JAR file specification.\n\n<P>\nThe manifest of the agent JAR file must contain the attribute <code>Premain-Class</code>. The\nvalue of this attribute is the name of the <i>agent class</i>. The agent class must implement a \npublic static <code>premain</code> method similar in principle to the <code>main</code> application \nentry point.  After the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) has initialized, each <code>premain</code> method \nwill be called in the order the agents were specified, then the real application\n<code>main</code> method will be called. \nEach <code>premain</code> method must return in order for the startup sequence to proceed.\n\n<P>\nThe <code>premain</code> method has one of two possible signatures. The JVM first attempts to\ninvoke the following method on the agent class:\n\n<blockquote>\n<code>public static void\npremain(String agentArgs, Instrumentation inst);\n</code>\n</blockquote>\n\n<P>\nIf the agent class does not implement this method then the JVM will attempt to invoke:\n\n<blockquote>\n<code>public static void\npremain(String agentArgs);\n</code>\n</blockquote>\n\n<P>\nThe agent class may also have an <code>agentmain</code> method for use when the agent is started \nafter VM startup. When the agent is started using a command-line option, the <code>agentmain</code>\nmethod is not invoked.\n\n\n<P>\nThe agent class will be loaded by the system class loader\n(see {@link java.lang.ClassLoader#getSystemClassLoader ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader}). This is\nthe class loader which typically loads the class containing the application <code>main</code> method.\nThe <code>premain</code> methods will be run under the same security and classloader \nrules as the application <code>main</code> method.\nThere are no modeling restrictions on what the agent <code>premain</code> method may do.\nAnything application <code>main</code> can do, including creating threads, is legal from <code>premain</code>.\n\n<P>\nEach agent is passed its agent options via the <code>agentArgs</code> parameter.\nThe agent options are passed as a single string,\nany additional parsing should be performed by the agent itself.\n\n<P>\nIf the agent cannot be resolved \n(for example, because the agent class cannot be loaded,\nor because the agent class does not have an appropriate <code>premain</code> method), the JVM will abort.\nIf a <code>premain</code> method throws an uncaught exception, the JVM will abort.\n\n\n\n<h3>Starting Agents After VM Startup</h3>\n\n<p>\nAn implementation may provide a mechanism to start agents sometime after the\nthe VM has started. The details as to how this is initiated are implementation \nspecific but typically the application has already started and its <code>\nmain</code> method has already been invoked. In cases where an implementation\nsupports the starting of agents after the VM has started the following applies:\n\n<ol>\n  <li><p>The manifest of the agent JAR must contain the attribute <code>Agent-Class</code>. \n      The value of this attribute is the name of the <i>agent class</i>. </p></li> \n      \n  <li><p>The agent class must implement a public static <code>agentmain</code> method. </p></li>\n\n  <li><p>The system class loader (\n      {@link java.lang.ClassLoader#getSystemClassLoader ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader}) must\n      support a mechanism to add an agent JAR file to the system class path. <p></li>\n</ol>  \n\n<P>\nThe agent JAR is appended to the system class path. This is the class loader that typically loads \nthe class containing the application <code>main</code> method. The agent class is loaded and the\nJVM attempts to invoke the <code>agentmain</code> method. The JVM first attempts to invoke \nthe following method on the agent class:\n\n<blockquote>\n<code>public static void\nagentmain(String agentArgs, Instrumentation inst);\n</code>\n</blockquote>\n\n<P>\nIf the agent class does not implement this method then the JVM will attempt to invoke:\n\n<blockquote>\n<code>public static void\nagentmain(String agentArgs);\n</code>\n</blockquote>\n\n<P>\nThe agent class may also have an <code>premain</code> method for use when the agent is started\nusing a command-line option. When the agent is started after VM startup the <code>premain</code>\nmethod is not invoked.\n\n\n<P>\nThe agent is passed its agent options via the <code>agentArgs</code> parameter.\nThe agent options are passed as a single string,\nany additional parsing should be performed by the agent itself. \n\n<P>\nThe <code>agentmain</code> method should do any necessary initialization \nrequired to start the agent. When startup is complete the method should \nreturn. If the agent cannot be started\n(for example, because the agent class cannot be loaded,\nor because the agent class does not have a conformant <code>agentmain</code> method), the JVM will\nnot abort. If the <code>agentmain</code> method throws an uncaught exception it will be ignored.\n\n\n\n<h3>Manifest Attributes</h3>\nThe following manifest attributes are defined for an agent JAR file:\n<blockquote>\n<dl>\n<dt><code>Premain-Class</code></dt>\n<dd>\n                        When an agent is specified at JVM launch time this attribute\n\t\t\tspecifies the agent class.\n\t\t\tThat is, the class containing the <code>premain</code> method.\n                        When an agent is specified at JVM launch time this attribute\n\t\t\tis required.

This class provides a set of \nstatic factory methods to obtain the MXBeans for the Java platform\nto allow an application to access the MXBeans directly.\n\n<p>A <em>platform MBeanServer</em> can be accessed with the\n{@link java.lang.management.ManagementFactory#getPlatformMBeanServer\n getPlatformMBeanServer} method.  On the first call to this method,\nit creates the platform MBeanServer and registers all platform MXBeans \nincluding platform MXBeans defined in other packages such as\n{@link java.util.logging.LoggingMXBean}.  \nEach platform MXBean is registered with a unique name defined in the\n{@link java.lang.management.ManagementFactory ManagementFactory} class\nfor constructing {@link javax.management.ObjectName ObjectName}. \nThis is a single MBeanServer that can be shared by different managed \ncomponents running within the same Java virtual machine.\n \n<h4>Interoperability</h4>\n\nA management application and a platform MBeanServer of a running\nvirtual machine can interoperate \nwithout requiring classes used by the platform MXBean interfaces.\nThe data types being transmitted between the JMX connector\nserver and the connector client are JMX\n{@link javax.management.openmbean.OpenType open types} and\nthis allows interoperation across versions.\n\n<p>A data type used by the MXBean interfaces are mapped to\nan open type when being accessed via MBeanServer interface.\nThe data type mapping is specified in the\n{@link java.lang.management.ManagementFactory ManagementFactory} class.\n\n<h4><a name=\"examples\">Ways to Access MXBeans</a></h4>\n\nThere are three different ways to access the management interfaces. \n\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Call the methods in the MXBean directly within the same \n    Java virtual machine.\n<blockquote><pre>\n   RuntimeMXBean mxbean = ManagementFactory.getRuntimeMXBean();\n\n   // Get the standard attribute \"VmVendor\"\n   String vendor = mxbean.getVmVendor();\n\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n\n<li>Go through a <tt>MBeanServerConnection</tt> connecting \n    to the <tt>platform MBeanServer</tt> of a running virtual machine.</li>\n<blockquote><pre>\n   MBeanServerConnection mbs;\n\n   // Connect to a running JVM (or itself) and get MBeanServerConnection\n   // that has the JVM MXBeans registered in it\n   ...\n\n   try {\n       // Assuming the RuntimeMXBean has been registered in mbs\n       ObjectName oname = new ObjectName(ManagementFactory.RUNTIME_MXBEAN_NAME);\n    \n       // Get standard attribute \"VmVendor\"\n       String vendor = (String) mbs.getAttribute(oname, \"VmVendor\");\n   } catch (....) {\n       // Catch the exceptions thrown by ObjectName constructor\n       // and MBeanServer.getAttribute method\n       ...\n   }\n\n</pre></blockquote>\n\n<li>Use MXBean proxy.</li>\n<blockquote><pre>\n   MBeanServerConnection mbs;\n\n   // Connect to a running JVM (or itself) and get MBeanServerConnection\n   // that has the JVM MBeans registered in it\n   ...\n\n   // Get a MBean proxy for RuntimeMXBean interface\n   RuntimeMXBean proxy = \n       ManagementFactory.newPlatformMXBeanProxy(mbs,\n                                                ManagementFactory.RUNTIME_MXBEAN_NAME,\n                                                RuntimeMXBean.class);\n   // Get standard attribute \"VmVendor\" \n   String vendor = proxy.getVmVendor();\n</pre></blockquote>\n</ol>\n\n\n<h4><a name=\"extension\">Platform Extension</a></h4>\n\nA Java virtual machine implementation may add its platform extension to\nthe management interface by defining platform-dependent\ninterfaces that extend the standard management interfaces to include\nplatform-specific metrics and management operations.  \nThe static factory methods in the <tt>ManagementFactory</tt> class will\nreturn the MBeans with the platform extension.\n\n<p>\nIt is recommended to name the platform-specific attributes with\na vendor-specific prefix such as the vendor\'s name to\navoid collisions of the attribute name between the future extension\nto the standard management interface and the platform extension.\nIf the future extension to the standard management interface defines\na new attribute for a management interface and the attribute name\nis happened to be same as some vendor-specific attribute\'s name,\nthe applications accessing that vendor-specific attribute would have\nto be modified to cope with versioning and compatibility issues.\n\n<p>Below is an example showing how to access a platform-specific\nattribute from Sun\'s implementation of the <tt>RuntimeMXBean</tt>.\n\n<p>\n1) Direct access to the Sun-specific MXBean interface\n<blockquote><pre>\n   com.sun.management.RuntimeMXBean mxbean = \n       (com.sun.management.RuntimeMXBean) ManagementFactory.getRuntimeMXBean();\n\n   // Get the standard attribute \"VmVendor\"\n   String vendor = mxbean.getVmVendor();\n\n   // Get the platform-specific attribute \"Bar\"\n   BarType bar = mxbean.getBar();\n\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\n2) Access the Sun-specific MXBean interface via <tt>MBeanServer</tt>\n\n<blockquote><pre>\n   MBeanServerConnection mbs;\n\n   // Connect to a running JVM (or itself) and get MBeanServerConnection\n   // that has the JVM MXBeans registered in it\n   ...\n\n   try {\n       // Assuming the RuntimeMXBean has been registered in mbs\n       ObjectName oname = new ObjectName(ManagementFactory.RUNTIME_MXBEAN_NAME);\n    \n       // Get standard attribute \"VmVendor\"\n       String vendor = (String) mbs.getAttribute(oname, \"VmVendor\");\n\n       // Check if this MXBean contains Sun\'s extension\n       if (mbs.isInstanceOf(oname, \"com.sun.management.RuntimeMXBean\")) {\n           // Get platform-specific attribute \"Bar\"\n           BarType bar = (String) mbs.getAttribute(oname, \"Bar\");\n       }\n   } catch (....) {\n       // Catch the exceptions thrown by ObjectName constructor\n       // and MBeanServer methods\n       ...\n   }\n\n</pre></blockquote>\n\n<p> Unless otherwise noted, passing a <tt>null</tt> argument to a constructor\nor method in any class or interface in this package will cause a {@link\njava.lang.NullPointerException NullPointerException} to be thrown.\n\n<p> The java.lang.management API is thread-safe.\n\n@see <a href=\"../../../javax/management/package-summary.html\">\n

'\n\n<p> Utility classes commonly useful in concurrent programming.  This\npackage includes a few small standardized extensible frameworks, as\nwell as some classes that provide useful functionality and are\notherwise tedious or difficult to implement.  Here are brief\ndescriptions of the main components. See also the <tt>locks</tt> and\n<tt>atomic</tt> packages.\n\n<h2>Executors</h2>\n\n<b>Interfaces.</b> {@link java.util.concurrent.Executor} is a simple\nstandardized interface for defining custom thread-like subsystems,\nincluding thread pools, asynchronous IO, and lightweight task\nframeworks.  Depending on which concrete Executor class is being used,\ntasks may execute in a newly created thread, an existing\ntask-execution thread, or the thread calling <tt>execute()</tt>, and\nmay execute sequentially or concurrently.  {@link\njava.util.concurrent.ExecutorService} provides a more complete\nasynchronous task execution framework.  An ExecutorService manages\nqueuing and scheduling of tasks, and allows controlled shutdown.  The\n{@link java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService} subinterface\nand associated interfaces add support for delayed and periodic task execution.\nExecutorServices provide methods arranging asynchronous execution of\nany function expressed as {@link java.util.concurrent.Callable}, the\nresult-bearing analog of {@link java.lang.Runnable}.  A {@link\njava.util.concurrent.Future} returns the results of a function, allows\ndetermination of whether execution has completed, and provides a means to\ncancel execution.  A {@link java.util.concurrent.RunnableFuture} is\na Future that possesses a <tt>run</tt> method that upon execution,\nsets its results.\n\n<p>\n\n<b>Implementations.</b> Classes {@link\njava.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor} and {@link\njava.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor} provide tunable,\nflexible thread pools. The {@link java.util.concurrent.Executors}\nclass provides factory methods for the most common kinds and\nconfigurations of Executors, as well as a few utility methods for\nusing them. Other utilities based on Executors include the concrete\nclass {@link java.util.concurrent.FutureTask} providing a common\nextensible implementation of Futures, and {@link\njava.util.concurrent.ExecutorCompletionService}, that assists in\ncoordinating the processing of groups of asynchronous tasks.\n\n<h2>Queues</h2>\n\nThe java.util.concurrent {@link\njava.util.concurrent.ConcurrentLinkedQueue} class supplies an\nefficient scalable thread-safe non-blocking FIFO queue.  Five\nimplementations in java.util.concurrent support the extended {@link\njava.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue} interface, that defines blocking\nversions of put and take: {@link\njava.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue}, {@link\njava.util.concurrent.ArrayBlockingQueue}, {@link\njava.util.concurrent.SynchronousQueue}, {@link\njava.util.concurrent.PriorityBlockingQueue}, and {@link\njava.util.concurrent.DelayQueue}. The different classes cover the most\ncommon usage contexts for producer-consumer, messaging, parallel\ntasking, and related concurrent designs. The {@link\njava.util.concurrent.BlockingDeque} interface extends\n<tt>BlockingQueue</tt> to support both FIFO and LIFO (stack-based)\noperations. Class {@link java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingDeque}\nprovides an implementation.\n\n\n<h2>Timing</h2>\n\nThe {@link java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit} class provides multiple\ngranularities (including nanoseconds) for specifying and controlling\ntime-out based operations.  Most classes in the package contain\noperations based on time-outs in addition to indefinite waits.  In all\ncases that time-outs are used, the time-out specifies the minimum time\nthat the method should wait before indicating that it\ntimed-out.  Implementations make a &quot;best effort&quot; to detect\ntime-outs as soon as possible after they occur.  However, an indefinite\namount of time may elapse between a time-out being detected and a\nthread actually executing again after that time-out.  All methods\nthat accept timeout parameters treat values less than or equal to\nzero to mean not to wait at all.  To wait \"forever\", you can use\na value of <tt>Long.MAX_VALUE</tt>.\n\n<h2>Synchronizers</h2>\n\nFour classes aid common special-purpose synchronization idioms.\n{@link java.util.concurrent.Semaphore} is a classic concurrency tool.\n{@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch} is a very simple yet very\ncommon utility for blocking until a given number of signals, events,\nor conditions hold.  A {@link java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier} is a\nresettable multiway synchronization point useful in some styles of\nparallel programming. An {@link java.util.concurrent.Exchanger} allows\ntwo threads to exchange objects at a rendezvous point, and is useful\nin several pipeline designs.\n\n<h2>Concurrent Collections</h2>\n\nBesides Queues, this package supplies Collection implementations\ndesigned for use in multithreaded contexts:\n{@link java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap},\n{@link java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentSkipListMap},\n{@link java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentSkipListSet},\n{@link java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList}, and\n{@link java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArraySet}.\nWhen many threads are expected to access a given collection,\na <tt>ConcurrentHashMap</tt> is normally preferable to\na synchronized <tt>HashMap</tt>, and a\n<tt>ConcurrentSkipListMap</tt> is normally preferable\nto a synchronized <tt>TreeMap</tt>. A\n<tt>CopyOnWriteArrayList</tt> is preferable to\na synchronized <tt>ArrayList</tt> when the expected number of reads\nand traversals greatly outnumber the number of updates to a list.\n\n<p>The \"Concurrent\" prefix used with some classes in this package is a\nshorthand indicating several differences from similar \"synchronized\"\nclasses. For example <tt>java.util.Hashtable</tt> and\n<tt>Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap())</tt> are\nsynchronized. But {@link java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap} is\n\"concurrent\".  A concurrent collection is thread-safe, but not\ngoverned by a single exclusion lock. In the particular case of\nConcurrentHashMap, it safely permits any number of concurrent reads as\nwell as a tunable number of concurrent writes.  \"Synchronized\" classes\ncan be useful when you need to prevent all access to a collection via\na single lock, at the expense of poorer scalability. In other cases in\nwhich multiple threads are expected to access a common collection,\n\"concurrent\" versions are normally preferable. And unsynchronized\ncollections are preferable when either collections are unshared, or\nare accessible only when holding other locks.\n\n<p> Most concurrent Collection implementations (including most Queues)\nalso differ from the usual java.util conventions in that their Iterators\nprovide <em>weakly consistent</em> rather than fast-fail traversal. A\nweakly consistent iterator is thread-safe, but does not necessarily\nfreeze the collection while iterating, so it may (or may not) reflect\nany updates since the iterator was created.\n\n<a name=\"MemoryVisibility\">\n<h2> Memory Consistency Properties </h2>\n\n<a href=\"http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/memory.html\">\nChapter 17 of the Java Language Specification</a> defines the\n<i>happens-before</i> relation on memory operations such as reads and\nwrites of shared variables.  The results of a write by one thread are\nguaranteed to be visible to a read by another thread only if the write\noperation <i>happens-before</i> the read operation.  The\n{@code synchronized} and {@code volatile} constructs, as well as the\n{@code Thread.start()} and {@code Thread.join()} methods, can form\n<i>happens-before</i> relationships. In particular:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Each action in a thread <i>happens-before</i> every action in that\n  thread that comes later in the program\'s order.\n\n  <li>An unlock ({@code synchronized} block or method exit) of a\n  monitor <i>happens-before</i> every subsequent lock ({@code synchronized}\n  block or method entry) of that same monitor. And because\n  the <i>happens-before</i> relation is transitive, all actions\n  of a thread prior to unlocking <i>happen-before</i> all actions\n  subsequent to any thread locking that monitor.\n\n  <li>A write to a {@code volatile} field <i>happens-before</i> every\n  subsequent read of that same field. Writes and reads of\n  {@code volatile} fields have similar memory consistency effects\n  as entering and exiting monitors, but do <em>not</em> entail\n  mutual exclusion locking.\n\n  <li>A call to {@code start} on a thread <i>happens-before</i> any action in the\n  started thread.\n\n  <li>All actions in a thread <i>happen-before</i> any other thread\n  successfully returns from a {@code join} on that thread.\n\n</ul>\n\n\nThe methods of all classes in {@code java.util.concurrent} and its\nsubpackages extend these guarantees to higher-level\nsynchronization. In particular:\n\n<ul>\n\n  <li>Actions in a thread prior to placing an object into any concurrent\n  collection <i>happen-before</i> actions subsequent to the access or\n  removal of that element from the collection in another thread.\n\n  <li>Actions in a thread prior to the submission of a {@code Runnable}\n  to an {@code Executor} <i>happen-before</i> its execution begins.\n  Similarly for {@code Callables} submitted to an {@code ExecutorService}.\n\n  <li>Actions taken by the asynchronous computation represented by a\n  {@code Future} <i>happen-before</i> actions subsequent to the\n  retrieval of the result via {@code Future.get()} in another thread.\n\n  <li>Actions prior to \"releasing\" synchronizer methods such as\n  {@code Lock.unlock}, {@code Semaphore.release}, and\n  {@code CountDownLatch.countDown} <i>happen-before</i> actions\n  subsequent to a successful \"acquiring\" method such as\n  {@code Lock.lock}, {@code Semaphore.acquire},\n  {@code Condition.await}, and {@code CountDownLatch.await} on the\n  same synchronizer object in another thread.\n\n  <li>For each pair of threads that successfully exchange objects via\n  an {@code Exchanger}, actions prior to the {@code exchange()}\n  in each thread <i>happen-before</i> those subsequent to the\n  corresponding {@code exchange()} in another thread.\n\n  <li>Actions prior to calling {@code CyclicBarrier.await}\n  <i>happen-before</i> actions performed by the barrier action, and\n  actions performed by the barrier action <i>happen-before</i> actions\n  subsequent to a successful return from the corresponding {@code await}\n  in other threads.\n\n</ul>\n\n@since 1.5\n\n',directive
